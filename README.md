### Background

Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD).  These three measurements allow scientists to unlock ocean patterns hidden beneath the sea surface. The ocean is not uniform, it its filled with swirling eddies, temperature boundaries, layers of high and low salinity, changing densities, and many other physical characteristics. To reveal these patterns in a tangible format, oceanographers employ a CTD probe. A CTD sonde is found on almost every major research vessel, and it is rare that a scientific expedition--whether it be coastal work in shallow estuaries or journeys to the deepest ocean trenches--begins without casting one.

### Overview

The OpenCTD is a low-cost, open-source CTD suitable for both educators and scientists. The platform is built using readily available parts and is powered by an Arduino-based microcontroller. Source codes, circuit diagrams, and building plans are freely available. The device  is accurate enough to be used for scientific research, can be constructed for less than $300, and is effective to 200 meters depth.  Why 200 meters depths? For many coastal regions, 200 meters of water depth covers the majority of the ocean that is accessible by small boat and generally the max depths of the continental shelf. The OpenCTD is targeted to people working in this niche, where entire research projects can be conducted for less than the cost of a commercial CTD. However, the Open CTD is scalable, and anyone with the inclination can adapt our plans to operate in deeper waters.

###Project Status

After success during our intial field trials in Lake Superior (see *Field Trials* section), and progress with conductivity sensor development, we are finalizing the design of OpenCTD during the Hack the Ocean conference in June 2016. During this build effort we will produce 3 sondes (1 to send to our early crowd fund donor, and 2 for field use), developing a detailed instruction guide, and creating video instructions to go along with the guide.

###Field Trials

Initial field trials were completed in October of 2015. Analysis of the data from the first several casts confirms the accuracy of OpenCTD. All data and field notes from the first Field Trial can be found in the [Blue Heron 15-11](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/master/Field_Trials/Blue_Heron_2015-11) repo.

### Bill of Materials

Almost all of the necessary parts can be found through Amazon. Visit our [Parts Depot](http://oceanographyforeveryone.com/depot.html) for the full list.

A 3" PVC pipe can be found at most home supply stores. 

The MS5803-14BA pressure sensor previously needed to be special ordered from a parts supplier, but hackable versions are now appearing on places like [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12909).

##Video Build Instructions



###Prepare the housing.

Print the OpenCTD baseplate which will serve as a form to position your sensors. Cut a 12 inch long piece of 3 inch PVC. Don't worry if the tube is label "not for pressure" as the device will be filled with mineral oil of other non-compressable liquids. Cut small holes or gaps in one end of the tube to allow water flow, this will be the bottom of the OpenCTD where the sensors go. 

###Prepare the electronics.

Mount the SD Card reader on your Arduino board. Connect the temperature probes in series; mount a 1 KOhm resistor between the positive and signal leads. Mount the pressure sensor by following the instructions provided by [the Cave Pearl Project](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/adding-a-ms5803-02-high-resolution-pressure-sensor/) (and send them a hearty thank you for providing such excellent, clear, directions). Mount the conductivity probe and circuit in accordance with the guidelines at [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/conductivity.html). Get creative with how you plan on packing everything into the tube. It will be a tight fit! I like to use plenty of connectors that allow you to quickly detach different components. 

###Potting

*Warning, after this step, there's no going back!*

Align the baseplate such that it is lightly recessed into the tube (when standing upright, non of the sensors should touch the ground). Hot glue it into place along the edges so the expoy won't leak out during potting. Lay the pressure sensor into the middle hole. Lightly cover the indentation with 2-ton epoxy, taking care not to let any come in contact with the membrane. Seat the sensor and apply more 2-ton epoxy above. This will provide added protection for this circuit. Place the three temperature sensor into the 3 small holes. Make sure that they do not sit so far out that you can't see some stainless steel in the inside. Place the conductivity probe in the only hole big enough for it. 

Once you are satisfied with everything's position, it's time for Hysol-90. Use an applicator to mix the expoxy as you pour it into the tube. I used an entire cartridge and had almost 2 cm of epoxy on the bottom. Let it cure overnight. Check periodically to make sure that nothing is leaking out of the bottom. 

###Your first cast. 

Power up the OpenCTD with your battery pack of choice (you'll want the full 12v). Confirm that it is writing data to the SD card. 

Now for the fun part. 

While everything is powered on, fill it with mineral oil. Mineral oil is non conductive and won't interfere with the electronics. Fill it top a few centimeters below the top. There will be some spillover if you're trying to avoid bubbles in the housing. Gentle lower the test cap down and screw it into place. You CTD is now sealed and logging. Wipe down any spilled oil. I find that these [microfiber cloths from Amazon](http://amzn.to/1RLdKZd) do a great job of sopping up small oil spills. It's a good idea to have them with you as you want to minimize any oil release into the water. 

Your OpenCTD is now ready to take the plunge!

##Calibration

Proper calibration of the OpenCTD requires access to already calibrated validation instruments. These can be commercial CTD, handheld systems, or bench-mounted laboratory systems. As the community grows, properly calibrated OpenCTDs can be used to benchmark newly-built instruments. 

###Depth

In order to minimize the amount of processing that happens onboard the OpenCTD, pressure is measured in millibars (the default output for the current pressure sensor). To convert pressure to depth use the following equation:

D = (P(depth) - P(surface) * 100) / (g * 1000)

Where D is depth in meters; P(depth) is the pressure (in millibars) at depth); P(surface) is the pressure at the surface in millibars; and g is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2).

No additional calibration shoud be need for the MS5803-14BA pressure sensor. 

###Temperature

Calibrating the temperature sensors requires access to an already calibrated instrument. Allow both the OpenCTD and the validation instrument to equilibrate in water for 15 minutes. Take the average of the three OpenCTD temperature outputs and note the difference between that average and the validation instrument. Repeat for two additional temperatures of at least 5 degrees difference. There should be a linear relationship between the OpenCTD temperature sensors and the validation instrument. Take the average of the difference between the three temperature readings and use as a calibration coefficient for your OpenCTD. 

This should remain steady for many casts, but it is always good practice to check you temperature calibration whenever you have access to a validation instrument.
